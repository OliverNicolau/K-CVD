% Instruction to install Ipelets on a Mac.

% (Similar with minor changes to the instruction given 
% https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/blog/ipe-cgal-ipelets/)


% Install Homebrew by copying the following command to the terminal promt:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

% Then install CGAL in the terminal promt:
brew install cgal

% Install Ipe at the website (download the *.dmg file and open it):
http://ipe.otfried.org/

% Open Ipe one time to finish the installation.

% Continue with some commands in the terminal promt:
cd .../CGAL_ipelets/demo/CGAL_ipelets/		(This is somewhere in the CGAL folder which was created when you installed it.)
cmake -DIPE_LIBRARIES=/Applications/Ipe.app/Contents/Frameworks/libipe.dylib -DIPE_INCLUDE_DIR=/Applications/Ipe.app/Contents/Frameworks/Headers/
make

mkdirr RenamingFolder

cp *.so .../CGAL_ipelets/demo/CGAL_ipelets/RenamingFolder/
cp lua/*.lua .../CGAL_ipelets/demo/CGAL_ipelets/RenamingFolder/

cd RenamingFolder

% Correct the endings of all *.so files:
brew install ren
ren '*.so' '#1.dylib'

cp *.dylib /Applications/Ipe.app/Contents/Resources/ipelets
cp *.lua /Applications/Ipe.app/Contents/Resources/ipelets

cd ..
rm -r RenamingFolder







For the ipelets in our group we had to do the following steps:
- Copy the CMakeLists.txt file of the CGAL_ipelets folder into our folder (we need a newer version since Ipe has had some changes)
- Delete the 4 files:
	CMakeCache.txt
	cmake_install.cmake
	Makefile
	install_manifest.txt
- Delete some parts out of this CMakeLists.txt file:
	set(CGAL_IPELETS ${CGAL_IPELETS} alpha_shapes)
	â€¦ (and following ones)
- Create one line for our functions
	set(CGAL_IPELETS ${CGAL_IPELETS} bisectors)
- Delete 3 additional line:
	add_library(simple_triangulation MODULE simple_triangulation.cpp)
	add_to_cached_list(CGAL_EXECUTABLE_TARGETS simple_triangulation)
	target_link_libraries(simple_triangulation ${IPE_LIBRARIES})
- Save the file

- Navigate with the terminal into the folder
- Type:
	cmake -DIPE_LIBRARIES=/Applications/Ipe.app/Contents/Frameworks/libipe.dylib -DIPE_INCLUDE_DIR=/Applications/Ipe.app/Contents/Frameworks/Headers/
	make
- Then continue with the renaming and copying procedure as for CGAL ipelets.


Maybe it is necessary to install additional Xcode parts.
