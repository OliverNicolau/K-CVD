1 # Introduction

2 # Structural properties
- region of a segment:
- Lemma 1 = all faces are unbounded:
- Corollary 2 = non-empty regions:
- O(n) faces, edges, vertices:
- graph of edges of FV(S) is connected:

3 # Dual setting
- upper envelope: compute duals of all segments, consider union of lower wedges,
  then define E as the boundary (edge) of this union.
  If you choose a point p on E so that it is contained only in a single lower
  wedge dual of segment s_i (it is on one of the "spikes"), then consider the
  ray R_p from p to -infinity and transform it into its dual open halfplane H_p
  (oriented upwards), then H_p will intersect every segment except s_i, and
  reg(s_i) will be unbounded in the positive direction with slope x, where x is
  the x-coordinate of the ray R_p.
- lower envelope: consider upper wedges, then choose p and consider the ray to
  +infinity, which becomes an open halfplane oriented downwards. reg(s_i) is
  unbounded in the negative direction with slope x, where x is the x-coordinate
  of the ray.
  Easier way to do this: rotate input by pi and repeat as upper envelope.

4 # Construction algorithm
- G-map: find unbounded edges in cyclical order using dual envelopes. First make
  make wedges out of all segments, then use divide and conquer and plane sweep
  to find upper envelope E of union of the dual wedges W_1, ... W_n.
  Save vertexes of E, they are the supporting lines of the halfplanes defining
  the unbounded edges which are bisectors between s_i and s_j, or between parts
  of regions (closest to the two endopoints of segment).
  The directions of the halfplanes (normal to the supporting lines) are the
  unbounded edges.
  These directions are also the normal lines of the edges of the furthest hull.
